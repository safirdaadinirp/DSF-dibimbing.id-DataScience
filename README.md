## Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates how to use the **Breast Cancer dataset** from **scikit-learn** and applies the **Logistic Regression** algorithm for binary classification. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is **malignant** (0) or **benign** (1) based on various features such as mean radius, mean texture, mean smoothness, etc.

## Project Overview
This project is focused on using **Logistic Regression** to classify breast cancer tumors based on a set of features. The dataset comes with a variety of features that describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsies. The classification is based on the following two possible outcomes:
- **Malignant (0)**: Tumor is cancerous.
- **Benign (1)**: Tumor is not cancerous.

The dataset consists of 569 samples with 30 features, each representing a measurement like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer dataset** from the **scikit-learn** library. This dataset includes the following:
- **30 features** describing characteristics of cell nuclei.
- **Target variable**: Malignant (0) or Benign (1).

The data is divided into:
- **X**: Features (30 numerical attributes).
- **y**: Target variable (0 or 1).

You can load the dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and datasets.
- **matplotlib**: (optional) For visualizations.

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
